#+TITLE: About GNU Mes

#+SUBTITLE: Maxwell Equations of Software

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/mes][GNU Mes]] is a Scheme interpreter and C compiler for bootstrapping the GNU
System.  Since version 0.20 it brings a [[https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2019/guix-reduces-bootstrap-seed-by-50/][Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap]] to
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/guix][GNU Guix]].  This bootstrap has halved the size of opaque, uninspectable
binary seeds that were needed to bootstrap Guix 1.0.  The final goal is
to help create a full source bootstrap as part of the [[http://bootstrappable.org][bootstrappable
builds]] effort for UNIX-like operating systems.

Mes consists of a mutual self-hosting Scheme interpreter written in
~5,000 LOC of simple C, and a C compiler written in Scheme.  This mes.c
is [[https://github.com/oriansj/mes-m2][being simplified]] to be transpiled by [[https://github.com/oriansj/m2-planet][M2-Planet]].

The Scheme interpreter has a Garbage Collector, a library of loadable
Scheme modules-- notably Dominique Boucher's [[https://github.com/schemeway/lalr-scm][LALR]], Pre-R6RS [[https://www.cs.indiana.edu/chezscheme/syntax-case/old-psyntax.html][portable
syntax-case]] with R7RS ellipsis, Matt Wette's [[https://www.nongnu.org/nyacc][Nyacc]] --and test suite,
just enough to support a REPL and a C99 compiler: mescc.

Mes+MesCC can compile an only [[http://gitlab.com/janneke/tinycc][lightly patched TinyCC]] that is
self-hosting.  Using this tcc and the Mes C library we now have a
Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap for the gnutools triplet: glibc-2.2.5,
binutils-2.20.1, gcc-2.95.3.  This is enough to bootstrap Guix for
i686-linux and x86_64-linux.

Mes is inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software: [[http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf][LISP-1.5]] -- John
McCarthy page 13, GNU Guix's source/binary packaging transparency and
Jeremiah Orians's [[https://github.com/oriansj/stage0][stage0]] ~500 byte self-hosting hex assembler.

GNU Mes is free software, it is distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public Licence version 3 or later.  See the file [[file:COPYING][COPYING]].
