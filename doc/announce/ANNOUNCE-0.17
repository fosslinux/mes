Subject: GNU Mes 0.17 released

<#secure method=pgpmime mode=sign>
We are delighted to announce the release of GNU Mes 0.17, representing
64 commits over 6 weeks.

Mes is now an official GNU package and we have bootstrapped gcc-4.7.4
for x86-linux with a reduced binary seed (i.e., without regular toolchain).

Next targets:

 - upstream the x86 Mes bootstrap to GuixSD
 - create a x86_64 Mes C Lib, see if that is is enough to bootstrap x86_64
 - reduce the 1MB ASCII M1 seed to ~5000 LOC/~100KB of M2 source
 - create a plan for Geesh and Gash and use them to reduce the
   bootstrap binary dependencies
 - and/or otherwise reduce the bootstrap binary dependencies

Packages are available from Guix's wip-bootstrap branch.

* About

GNU Mes[0] aims to help create full source bootstrapping for GNU/Linux
distributions such as GuixSD[1] as part of the bootstrappable builds[2]
effort.

It consists of a mutual self-hosting Scheme interpreter written in
~5,000 LOC of simple C and a Nyacc-based C compiler written in Scheme.
This mes.c is being simplified[3] to be transpiled by M2-Planet[4].

The Scheme interpreter (mes.c) has a Garbage Collector, a library of
loadable Scheme modules-- notably Dominique Boucher's LALR[5],
Pre-R6RS portable syntax-case[6] with R7RS ellipsis, Matt Wette's
Nyacc[7] --and test suite just barely enough to support a simple REPL
and simple C-compiler: MesCC.

Mes+MesCC can compile an only lightly patched TinyCC[8] that is
self-hosting.  Using this tcc and the Mes C library we now have a
reduced-binary-seed bootstrap for the gnutools triplet: glibc-2.2.5,
binutils-2.20.1, gcc-4.7.4.

Mes is inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software: LISP-1.5[9] --
John McCarthy page 13, GNU Guix's source/binary packaging transparency
and Jeremiah Orians's stage0[10] ~500 byte self-hosting hex assembler.

  [*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
  .sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
  and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

    gpg --verify mes-0.17.tar.gz.sig

  If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
  then run this command to import it:

    gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 1A858392E331EAFDB8C27FFBF3C1A0D9C1D65273

  and rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

Mes runs from the source tree and can also be built, packaged and
installed in Guix[SD] from a git checkout by running

    guix package -f .guix.scm
