Subject: GNU Mes 0.18 released

<#secure method=pgpmime mode=sign>
We are pleased to announce the release of GNU Mes 0.18, representing
83 commits over 8 weeks.

Mes is now bringing a Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap to GuixSD; the
size of bootstrap binaries has been halved and no regular toolchain
binaries are used as binary seeds (i686-linux and x86_64-linux only).

MesCC has been refactored to use an abstracted assembly language and
can now (cross-)build x86_64 binaries.

Next targets:

 - reduce the 1MB ASCII M1 seed to ~5000 LOC/~100KB of M2 source
 - revive Gash/Geesh and use it to decimate the remaining bootstrap
   binary seeds
 - and/or otherwise reduce the bootstrap binaries
 - ARM, the Hurd?

Packages are available from Guix's core-updates-next branch.

* About

  GNU Mes[0] brings a Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap[1] to GuixSD[2] and
  potentially to any other interested GNU/Linux distribution, and aims
  to help create a full source bootstrap as part of the
  bootstrappable builds[3] effort.

  It consists of a mutual self-hosting Scheme interpreter written in
  ~5,000 LOC of simple C and a Nyacc-based C compiler written in Scheme.
  This mes.c is being simplified[4] to be transpiled by M2-Planet[5].

  The Scheme interpreter (mes.c) has a Garbage Collector, a library of
  loadable Scheme modules-- notably Dominique Boucher's LALR[6], Pre-R6RS
  [portable syntax-case[7] with R7RS ellipsis, Matt Wette's Nyacc[8] --and test
  suite just barely enough to support a simple REPL and simple
  C-compiler: MesCC.

  Mes+MesCC can compile an only lightly patched TinyCC[9] that is
  self-hosting.  Using this tcc and the Mes C library we now have a
  Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap for the gnutools triplet: glibc-2.2.5,
  binutils-2.20.1, gcc-2.95.3.  This is enough to bootstrap GuixSD for
  i686-linux and x86_64-linux.

  Mes is inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software: LISP-1.5[10] -- John
  McCarthy page 13, GNU Guix's source/binary packaging transparency and
  Jeremiah Orians's stage0[11] ~500 byte self-hosting hex assembler.

  [*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
  .sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
  and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

    gpg --verify mes-0.18.tar.gz.sig

  If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
  then run this command to import it:

    gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 1A858392E331EAFDB8C27FFBF3C1A0D9C1D65273

  and rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

Mes runs from the source tree and can also be built, packaged and
installed in Guix[SD] from a git checkout by running

    guix package -f .guix.scm
