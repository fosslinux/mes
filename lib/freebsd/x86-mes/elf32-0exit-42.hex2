### Commentary:

# elf32-exit-42.hex2: `exit 42' for i686-freebsd written in hex2 assembly,
# for usage with elf32-0header.hex2.  This produces a 112-byte binary
# (70 hex).  Inspiration was taken from GNU Gcc output of exit-42.S.

### Code:

# DEFINE SYS_exit 1

# @60
:ELF_text
b8 01 00 00 00                 # mov    SYS_exit,%eax
68 2a 00 00 00                 # push   $42
68 00 00 00 00                 # push   $00
cd 80                          # int    $0x80
f4                             # hlt

      00 00  00 00 00 00       # align to @80
