/* FIXME: We want bin/mes-mescc's x86-linux sha256sum to stay the same.
   Therfore we cannot remove stdlib/malloc from libc_SOURCES, which is
   what GNU suggests.

   move stdlib/malloc.c to unix/malloc.c and move it from shared
   libc_SOURCES to linux-specific list when the checksum of mes.c
   changes. */
