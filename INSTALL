#+TITLE: Building and Installing GNU Mes

Mes can be built in two modes: as a regulare package build or as a
bootstrap package.

After bootstrapping Mes it can be used to bootstrap TinyCC (tcc) in a
similar way.

* Get it
   git clone [[git://git.savannah.gnu.org][git://git.savannah.gnu.org/mes.git]]

* Regular build
** Prerequisites
*** Guix
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   guix environment -l guix.scm     #64 bit + 32bit
   guix environment --system=i686-linux -l guix.scm #32 bit only
   #+END_SRC

*** Other GNU/Linux
  - [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/mescc-tools/][mescc-tools]], 0.6.1 is known to work.
  - [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/nyacc][Nyacc]], 0.93.0 is known to work.
  - GNU Gcc, 4.9.3 is known to work.
  - GNU Guile, version 2.0.12 or is know to work.
  - SH, /bin/sh, GNU Bash 4.3 is known to work.
  - GNU coreutils
  - sed, GNU sed 4.2 is known to work.
  - Perl, 5.22 is known to work.

** Build it

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ./configure
   make
   #+END_SRC

If you get something like

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   mes.c:(.text+0x8da0): undefined reference to `__stack_chk_fail'
   #+END_SRC

then your compiler inserts stack protection code.  The Mes C Library
does not support that.  Turn it off lik this

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ./configure CFLAGS=-fno-stack-protector
   #+END_SRC

** Check it

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make check
   #+END_SRC

** Install it

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make install
   #+END_SRC

* Guix it

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   guix build -f guix.scm
   #+END_SRC

* Bootstrap build

The bootstrap build is part of Guix, see
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/packages/commencement.scm

** Prerequisites
  - [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/mescc-tools/][mescc-tools]], 0.6.1 is known to work.
  - [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/nyacc][Nyacc]], 0.93.0 is known to work.

** Build it

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sh configure.sh [--prefix=<prefix>]
   sh bootstrap.sh
   #+END_SRC

** Check it

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sh check.sh
   #+END_SRC

** Install it

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sh install.sh
   #+END_SRC
* Regular build and bootstrap combine

To build mes.c using MesCC, configure using --with-bootstrap:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ./configure --with-bootstrap
   make
   #+END_SRC

This creates bin/mes-gcc and bin/mes-mescc.
