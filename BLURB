GNU Mes is a Scheme interpreter and C compiler for bootstrapping the GNU
system.

GNU Mes was created to address the security concerns that arise from
bootstrapping an operating system using binary blobs, which is common
practice for all software distributions.  Mes is a Scheme interpreter
written in a simple subset of C and a C compiler written in Scheme and
comes with a small, bootstrappable C library.  The Mes bootstrap has
halved the size of opaque, uninspectable binaries that were needed to
bootstrap GNU Guix, a functional GNU/Linux distribution that focusses on
user freedom, reproducibility and security.  That reduction was achieved
by replacing GNU Binutils, GNU GCC and the GNU C Library with Mes.  The
final goal is to help create a full source bootstrap for UNIX-like
operating systems.  After three years of volunteer work funding will
enable us to make another big step forward and reach an important new
milestone.
